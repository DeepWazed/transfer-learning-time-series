## Transfer learning for Time Series Forecasting
Transfer learning refers to the process of pre-training a flexible model on a large dataset and using it later on other data with little to no training. It is one of the most outstanding ðŸš€ achievements in Machine Learning ðŸ§  and has many practical applications.

For time series forecasting, the technique allows you to get lightning-fast predictions âš¡ bypassing the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.

This notebook shows how to generate a pre-trained model and store it in a checkpoint to make it available for public use to forecast new time series never seen by the model. 
If you want to see a proof of concept in action you can vistit this [Demo](http://nixtla.io/transfer_learning/)

If you want to use our [Low Latency API]([docs.nixtla.io/](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/neural_transfer_neural_transfer_post)) for forecasting you can SingUp [here](nixtla.io/transfer-learning). 

**You can contribute with your pre-trained models by following [this Notebook](https://github.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/edit/main/README.md) and sending us an email at federico[at]nixtla.io**

You can also take a look at list of pretrained models here.  Currently we have this ones avaiable in our [API](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/neural_transfer_neural_transfer_post) or [Demo](http://nixtla.io/transfer_learning/). You can alos download the `.ckpt`:
