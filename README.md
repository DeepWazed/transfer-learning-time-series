## Transfer learning for Time Series Forecasting
Transfer learning refers to the process of pre-training a flexible model on a large dataset and using it later on other data with little to no training. It is one of the most outstanding ðŸš€ achievements in Machine Learning ðŸ§  and has many practical applications.

For time series forecasting, the technique allows you to get lightning-fast predictions âš¡ bypassing the tradeoff between accuracy and speed (more than 30 times faster than our alreadsy fast [autoARIMA](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) for a similar accuracy).

This notebook shows how to generate a pre-trained model and store it in a checkpoint to make it available for public use to forecast new time series never seen by the model. 
If you want to see a proof of concept in action you can vistit this [Demo]((http://nixtla.io/transfer_learning/)

If you want to use our Low Latency API for forecasting you can SingUp [here](nixtla.io/transferlearning). 

**You can contribute with your pre-trained models by following [this Notebook](https://github.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/edit/main/README.md) and sending us an email at federico[at]nixtla.io**
